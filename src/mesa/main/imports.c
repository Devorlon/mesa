/**
 * \file imports.c
 * Standard C library function wrappers.
 * 
 * Imports are services which the device driver or window system or
 * operating system provides to the core renderer.  The core renderer (Mesa)
 * will call these functions in order to do memory allocation, simple I/O,
 * etc.
 *
 * Some drivers will want to override/replace this file with something
 * specialized, but that'll be rare.
 *
 * Eventually, I want to move roll the glheader.h file into this.
 *
 * \todo Functions still needed:
 * - scanf
 * - qsort
 * - rand and RAND_MAX
